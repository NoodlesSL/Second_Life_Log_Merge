# Second Life Log Merge

A simple Python script that will take two time stamped log files from Second Life and merge them togther into one file, ordered by time stamp.

It probably has some flakey-ness because it's kind of "quick and dirty".  It's mostly useful if you use Second Life on more than one computer and want to merge log files from the same group or person into one combined log file.

The script asks for file names for each log file, it probably works best if you remove spaces.  

Output file is simply called "combined_log.txt", feel free to rename it whatever you want.\
